## [Unreleased]

## [2026.04.27] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Added adapter STEP files, assembled PDF drawings, and installation instructions under `step/adapter/` for the direct adapter and the impact-resistant adapter.
- Added simplified structural STEP files for the left and right hand frames (with temporary fingertips) under `step/simplified-structural/`.

### Removed

- Removed the legacy top-level `step/left_hand.STEP` and `step/right_hand.STEP` files in favor of the new `step/adapter/` and `step/simplified-structural/` layout.
### Fixed

- Fixed thumb mesh vertices on both hands (`finger1_link1`, `finger1_link2`, `finger1_tip_link`); URDF, MJCF, and USD updated accordingly to match the new thumb geometry.

## [2026.04.16] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Unified left/right hand joint <limit> bounds across all four URDF files using averaged calibrated values.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Added docking module assets including URDF, MJCF, STL mesh, and USD files.

### Fixed

- Replaced all URDF, MJCF, and mesh files with sysid-calibrated outputs, fixing left-right inconsistencies in joint axes, inertials, and kinematics.
- Corrected joint axis directions for consistent rotation conventions.
- Updated actuator parameters, joint limits, and inertial properties from sysid results.
- Regenerated ROS URDF variants to match calibrated versions.
- Removed spurious <limit> elements from fixed joints in right-hand URDFs.
- Fixed wrong ROS package path in docking-ros.urdf.

### Changed

- CMakeLists.txt now installs mjcf/ and usd/ directories for ROS consumers.
- README documents docking module preview usage.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Added USD assets for NVIDIA Isaac Sim with fused meshes, PBR materials, physics properties, and collision filter pairs.
- Added README guidance for loading the USD assets in Isaac Sim.
- Added an MIT license file for the public repository.

### Changed

- Standardized the MCP2 joint limits of the four non-thumb fingers to `-0.37` to `0.37` across the URDF, MJCF, and USD models.
- Refreshed the README structure and usage examples to match the current repository contents.

### Fixed

- Corrected repository metadata and package links for the current `wuji-hand-description` repository.
- Corrected package version metadata for the `0.2.4` release.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Standardized left and right hand joint limits using averaged calibrated values across the hand models.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- Fixed mesh references in the URDF models so left and right hand assets load correctly in local tools.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed

- Fixed the robot name in the left-hand models.
- Fixed inertia values.
- Fixed joint motion range limits.
- Fixed joint torque limits.
- Fixed self-collision groups.
- Fixed the RViz fixed frame for right hand visualization.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-19

### Changed

- Removed the version suffix from the robot name.
- Unified the left and right hand ROS2 visualization entry points behind a single launch interface with a `hand` selector.
- Streamlined the ROS2 package installation layout for visualization workflows.

### Fixed

- Fixed the RViz robot description topic handling so visualization works correctly inside a ROS2 namespace.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- Added URDF models for Wuji Hand left and right hands.
- Added MJCF models for MuJoCo simulation.
- Added high-quality STL meshes for visualization and collision.
- Added ROS2 launch files for left and right hands.
- Added RViz configuration files for robot display.
- Added ROS2 package build configuration.
